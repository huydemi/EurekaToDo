# EurekaToDo

This Eureka tutorial will teach you how to use Eureka’s essential building blocks by crafting the interface of a simple to-do app called EurekaToDo.

You’ll see how Eureka makes it easy to set up various commonly-used user interface elements such as date pickers, text fields and segmented controls with no boilerplate UIKit code!

In addition:

- Eureka’s components are very flexible and extensible out-of-the-box and cover the majority of use cases. Eureka makes it easy to implement your custom components if your needs get more specific. Examples of community-generated plugins include a GooglePlacesRow and an ImageRow, which you’ll get to use in this Eureka tutorial.
- Eureka is a well-documented library with plenty of helpful tips and examples available through its official Github portal.
